                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="display: flex; height: 450px; width: 60%;" src="https://seqsparky.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/reliable-electrical-services-in-mount-gravatt-east-768x512.jpg"></div>
                    <p>When it comes to your home or business, safety and efficiency matter. Whether it’s a faulty switch, a complete rewiring job, or electrical upgrades for new appliances, you want the peace of mind that comes from working with someone who knows exactly what they’re doing.</p>
                    <p>At SEQ Sparky Pty Ltd, based in Mount Gravatt East, we provide dependable electrical services that meet the needs of Brisbane households and businesses. From everyday maintenance to urgent repairs and complex installations, our team of licensed electricians is committed to getting the job done right the first time.</p>
                    <h2>Why Choosing Qualified Experts for Electrical Services Matters</h2>
                    <p>Electrical work is never something to gamble on. Incorrect wiring, overloaded circuits, or poorly installed components can put lives and property at risk. In Australia, all electrical work must meet the standards of the AS/NZS 3000 Wiring Rules — and for good reason.</p>
                    <p>When you hire SEQ Sparky, you’re not just ticking a box for compliance. You’re investing in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safer homes and workplaces</li>
                        <li>Better energy efficiency</li>
                        <li>Long-term reliability</li>
                        <li>Insurance peace of mind</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every job we take on is handled with diligence, care, and deep technical knowledge — because your safety is non-negotiable.</p>
